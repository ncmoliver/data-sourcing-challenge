# Movie Sourcing Using NYT & TMDB API
# Overview
This is by far the most fun I have had thus far in my Bootcamp experience. This program was designed to test everything we have learned up to this point, by using data extracted from the New York Times and The Movie Database API's. This program channels movie titles retrieved from the New York Times API into The Movie Database API to pull the associate movies details for each movie.     
Ultimately we made two dataframe out the information retrieved from both endpoints and combined them into one dataframe. Once combined, we were tasked with cleaning the data and exporting a clean version of the combined data. 
## Description
Creates clean visualizaton for analyzing movie data using movie titles from the NYT API to search for additional information on the TMDB database. 
### Use Cases
* Collecting movie-related articles from NYT API
* Building datasets for movie trend analysis   
### Featured Skills
* API Request with Python
* Data extraction and Datafrom creation using Pandas
### Knowledge Acquired
* Understanding API request methods and authentication
* Using .env to secure API Keys
* Handling JSON responses and converting them to DataFrames
